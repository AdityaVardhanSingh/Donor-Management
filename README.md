# Donor-Management

This is a full stack application using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The implementation of the specific CRUD operations, API endpoints, database connections, and error handling will require further detailed coding.
. **Donor Registration:**
   - The frontend presents a user-friendly form (DonorForm component) for users to input their details and preferences.
   - Upon form submission, the data is sent to the backend via an API call to add a new donor to the database.

2. **CRUD Operations:**
   - **Create:** Admins can add new donors by submitting the donor information through the frontend form.
   - **Read:** The DonorList component displays the list of donors fetched from the backend API.
   - **Update:** Admins can edit donor information by selecting a donor from the list and updating their details.
   - **Delete:** Admins can remove donors from the database by selecting a donor from the list and deleting their record.
